You are a fresh candidate verifier. You did not hunt this candidate. Try to refute it independently from current source. Review source only; the parent has not verified all required sandbox and promotion controls, so do not execute target code or write files. Return exactly one JSON object with decision confirmed, needs_validation, or rejected and a matching final schema-shaped record, with no prose.

## Architecture

# Skyttel security architecture

Skyttel is a shared household map for digital and financial relationships.
Authenticated household members read and edit the common map while their
unsaved drafts remain private. Household administrators control invitations,
membership, full export, import, and permanent erasure. The installation
operator configures the first administrator, provider credentials, persistent
SQLite database, origin, and authority generation. See `README.md:3-24`,
`GLOSSARY.md:52-65`, and `src/server/config.ts:52-125`.

The application is a Node.js 24 Hono server with a React/Vite browser client,
Better Auth Google/Microsoft sign-in, SQLite storage, optional OpenAI text and
voice features, an OAuth MCP assistant endpoint, and a WebSocket task-delivery
path. The source selects a Docker runtime with a persistent `/data` volume;
Compose binds its port to loopback while other deployment ingress is operator
configured. See `package.json:6-68`, `src/server/index.ts:10-29`,
`Dockerfile:23-50`, `compose.yaml:1-20`.

Comparable source-grounded protocols are OAuth/OIDC for sign-in, OAuth2 for MCP
access, WebSocket task delivery, and WebRTC for voice. Their identity, browser
origin, token scope, and connection-bound authority are the useful comparison
points; no external product's controls are assumed.

The primary HTTP entry is `src/server/app.ts:180-410`. Authentication and
browser binding are enforced in `src/server/auth.ts:23-96` and
`src/server/browser-binding.ts:192-275`. Household membership and draft scope
are checked in `src/server/households.ts:11-31` and
`src/server/map.ts:55-118`. Administrative operations are gated in
`src/server/administration.ts:19-25`; import, export, and erasure have separate
route and domain checks. ZIP upload reaches
`src/server/household-import.ts:196-400` through bounded parsing in
`src/server/import-archive.ts:13-124` and reference checks in
`src/server/import-references.ts:22-155`.

The MCP path binds OAuth tokens, household membership, consent, and tool scopes
in `src/server/assistant-routes.ts:86-299`. The built-in assistant processes
browser text and model tool arguments in `src/server/text-assistant.ts`; the
voice path accepts SDP in `src/server/voice-assistant.ts:218-263`. WebSocket
upgrade is attached directly to the Node server at
`src/server/task-delivery-transport.ts:22-59`, outside the Hono fetch wrapper.
The browser retains optional consent and login preferences in local storage.

The audit covers the working tree at
`e79b5b97cfe73563dc7b028852176cd9521deb70`, with three pre-existing dirty
paths recorded in run metadata. No compatible prior audit ledger was found.
Source inspection is available. Target-controlled builds, tests, or fixtures
will not run unless every required OS sandbox control, including total scratch
disk bounds and race-safe artifact promotion, is verified. Repository npm test
scripts inherit the ambient environment and write a shared lock, so they do
not themselves supply those controls (`scripts/testing/run-with-test-environment.py:39-56`).
Billable provider suites are outside this run.

Coverage starts at the HTTP/browser session, map and administrator decisions,
ZIP and image parsers, assistant and WebSocket paths, deployment configuration,
and release chain. Selected companions are HTTP/auth, client-side, data
isolation, AI/LLM, protocol messaging, resource exhaustion, cloud/deployment,
and supply chain. Native desktop/mobile IPC and memory-unsafe application
code are not source-visible; native dependencies remain a supply-chain and
image-processing boundary rather than an invented application entry surface.


## Exact relevant companion validation rules

## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name untrusted input, requester work, service amplification or retained resource, shared blast radius, and recovery. Missing limits without concrete shared impact are hardening.
2. Confirm no source-visible upstream, parser, queue, tenant, or framework bound prevents the path. Unknown deployed controls require `needs_validation`.
3. For superlinear behavior, establish the accepted complexity and bounded local growth. For leaks, show repeatable retention after cleanup should occur. For fatal paths, identify process/supervisor isolation.
4. Prioritize by low requester work, unauthenticated reachability, cross-tenant scope, persistence, and poor recovery; do not validate with availability impact.
5. Return `confirmed` only with safe local proof and meaningful shared effect. Return `needs_validation` with the exact upstream limit, topology, quota, or recovery observation an owner must check.

## Candidate verifier method and promotion procedure (verbatim)

#### Candidate-verifier prompt

```text
You did not write this candidate. Try to refute it from repository source and bounded
local evidence. Do not contact deployed endpoints or external/shared services. Run
target-controlled code only inside the approved OS-enforced sandbox: no external
network, empty allowlisted environment, read-only target and tools, scratch-only
writes, and explicit low resource and wall-clock limits. If any control is unavailable,
do not execute; retain the exact missing capability as a needs_validation blocker.
Treat every scratch entry as target-controlled after execution. After the sandbox and
all its processes terminate, only trusted parent-side code may promote a predeclared
scratch-relative file, following the promotion procedure block included verbatim in
this prompt. You and target code never write retained artifacts. If promotion is
unavailable or fails, do not use that file as evidence.

1. Verify every trace and evidence file, positive line number, scope, and description.
   Confirm the first entry is a real lower-trust entrypoint and the last is the
   claimed sink or boundary effect.
2. Reconstruct the strongest source-visible validation, identity, authorization,
   normalization, lifecycle, framework, and containment controls on the path.
   Where the architecture summary names a comparable baseline, note whether it
   shares the pattern — as calibration, never as grounds to dismiss.
3. For a proposed confirmed candidate, independently reproduce the minimum observed
   result when possible. Verify inputs, interface shape, conditions, and affected
   dummy principal/resource. Do not infer a stronger result or continue after it.
4. Verify that likelihood, impact, confidence, and the proposed source fix match only
   what the evidence establishes.
5. For a proposed needs_validation candidate, decide whether the blocker is genuinely
   outside source/local observation. If source refutes the trace, reject it. If the
   missing fact remains decisive, keep needs_validation and make the local and
   owner-observed plans exact and non-destructive.
6. Preserve the fingerprint for the same source-derived root cause across every state.

Return exactly one JSON object and no surrounding prose:
{"decision": "confirmed|needs_validation|rejected", "record": { ... }}
where record exactly matches the decision's verdict branch of the schema included
in this prompt. A corrected record replaces the hunter's wording.
```

Copy this promotion procedure verbatim into every candidate-verifier prompt:

```text
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.
