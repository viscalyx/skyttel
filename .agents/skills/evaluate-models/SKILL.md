# Evaluate models

Determine whether the models supplied by the user meet Skyttel's requirements
and whether the evidence supports choosing them over the application model.
Evaluate correctness first, then response time and cost. Deliver a
recommendation backed by reproducible results in `model-evaluation` issues,
one per evaluated model, effort and modality.

## Establish the comparison

Use the user's models, intended text or voice use, and payment authorization.
Ask for missing models or payment authorization before making paid calls.
Apply a spending limit only when the user specifies one, using its stated
scope. An authorized run without a specified budget has no cost ceiling.
Resolve the provider for each supplied model; ask the user when it is unclear.
Confirm that the selected providers are supported and their required credentials
are available to this session. If a key or token is missing, stop paid execution
and explain how to configure it using the credential guidance in
[run support](references/run-support.md).
Identify the model currently used by the application from its effective
configuration. Its corresponding result in a `model-evaluation` issue is the
baseline for comparison. Reuse that result; run the application model or any
previously tested model again only when the user explicitly supplies it.

Test each supplied model at its requested effort directly. A supplied high
profile starts at high; lower-effort results are not prerequisites. Explore
other efforts only when the user requests an effort survey.

For a voice comparison, select the backend model and effort from the supplied
models' text evidence before creating the voice issue. Reuse recorded text
results or complete the selected text evaluations first. Choose the candidate
whose correctness, response time and cost support the comparison, and record
the linked text result and selection reason. If the text evidence supports no
candidate, report the gap and defer automatic voice selection. A user-supplied
voice backend can be evaluated directly, with its qualification state reported.
Record the voice model and backend profile together; use the application's
recorded voice result as the comparison reference.

Search open and closed `model-evaluation` issues in `viscalyx/skyttel`,
including corrections. Identify comparable results by catalog, fixture, commit,
profile, scoring configuration, modality, limits and repetitions. Explain gaps
that prevent a comparison. One repetition is preliminary; three passing
repetitions qualify a model.

## Gather evidence

Before paid execution, read [run support](references/run-support.md) for the
runner interface, local verification, provider verification and cost accounting.
Create one issue for each supplied model and effort level using the title and
description templates in [issue templates](references/issue-templates.md).
Evaluating the same model at low and high effort creates two separate issues.
Execute and account for each model independently so a stopped model does not
prevent the others from completing. Reuse completed results when evaluating
another model.
Use `scripts/model-evaluation/evaluate.ts` to exercise the real application
against the checked-in catalog. The runner owns scenario ordering, fixtures,
audio, timing and result collection; keep those consistent across runs.

Use the catalog and approved scoring controls as the evaluation contract.
Preserve real MCP writes, receipts and history. A failed calibration or unknown
charge stops paid comparison. Record failures and missing evidence as observed;
never retry a verdict to improve it or count an unrun attempt as successful.
Account for every paid layer; enforce any user-specified budget across its
authorized scope.

## Deliver a decision

Publish each model's versioned results on its issue, using
the publication guidance in [run support](references/run-support.md). Compare
qualified models with the application's recorded baseline.
Recommend a model when correctness and the comparison rules support it;
otherwise explain which evidence is missing. Report regressions and costs
alongside any response-time improvement. Leave production model selection to
the user.

The work is complete when every model issue accounts for its selected attempts
and contains the recommendation, evidence and limitations, actual spending,
remaining budget when applicable and work needed to finish qualification.
A stopped model still needs that report; it remains an incomplete evaluation.
Link the model issues in the final response so the user can select individual
follow-up runs.
