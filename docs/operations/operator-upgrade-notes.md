# Operator Upgrade Notes

This file records release-specific actions that production operators must know
before upgrading Skyttel.

## Unreleased

### Daily image security monitoring

Before rollout, configure the operator who receives security alerts and
verify delivery through GitHub. Review the latest successful scan of the
running and retained recovery images before each production update and at
least monthly. Missing or stale evidence means that current status is
unknown. Check security updates and exception expiry each week.

Keep the running and previous successfully deployed images, their deployment
records, and their verification evidence outside temporary build cleanup.
An older image with an unresolved finding remains unsafe for recovery even
after a fixed image enters production. Follow the private security contact
procedure for investigation details.

### Editable object types and custom fields

Back up the persistent database and retain its matching image before upgrade.
Startup adds storage for editable object definitions and custom field values.
Existing definitions, objects, and private drafts remain. Use the upgraded
image with this database. Stop the application and restore the matching
backup before returning to an older image.

Definitions and field values can occur in private drafts, saved objects,
receipts, and history. Apply the same backup access restrictions and retention
rules to these records as to other household content. Clients that read save
results must include definition changes when they describe the whole save.

### Production terminal access

Before rollout, review who can use the production host's terminals. The
container supports Render's managed SSH access. After administrator setup,
close terminal sessions and remove temporary operator access or SSH keys.
If access must be restricted further, protect the Render project environment
so only workspace Admins can use its terminals. Admins retain maintenance
access; closing a session does not prevent a new session.

Keep existing household identities and settings when upgrading. The
production first-administrator procedure is only for a new installation;
it does not transfer an existing household or restore removed membership.

### Automatic Render deployment

Configure the production deployment environment and one image-based Render
service with a persistent disk before enabling automatic updates. A verified
release from the main branch now changes production automatically. Keep the
same disk and authentication secret. Expect a short interruption and enable
deployment-failure notifications. Keep other deployment paths disabled.

After failure, establish the actual running image and database state before
retry. Wait for any active migration. Return to older code only when it is
compatible with the current database; changing the image does not restore
data. No extra automatic backup is added. Full household export and reimport
remain the planned recovery path and are not yet available.

Ask users to preserve unsent text and reload old browser sessions after an
update. Outdated sessions cannot submit changes. An interrupted save must
be checked through its receipt before its outcome is treated as known.

### Verified container releases

Before using a published image, verify its source and signed evidence. Read
the upgrade guidance attached to that release and select the image by its
digest. Releases from the main branch proceed to automatic deployment;
stable release tags do not change the running installation.

Retain the current image and each planned recovery image with their matching
release evidence and database backup. Keep this material after temporary
build artifacts expire. Do not replace the content of an existing release
version or remove evidence needed for recovery.

### Recovery of interrupted saves

Back up the persistent database and retain its matching image before upgrade.
Startup preserves existing household content, private drafts, and save receipts.
It adds persistent records of pending and rejected save attempts. An older image
requires its matching database backup. Stop the application before restoring
that backup; changes after the backup will not be present.

After rollout, ask users to preserve unsent form text and reload open browser
sessions to make the recovery controls available. After an interrupted save or
restart, have the affected user check their save attempts before changing the
draft. The same user can check and retry a pending attempt from another device.
A missing response does not establish that the save failed. Apply existing backup
access restrictions and retention rules to private save attempts as well as
drafts and household content.

### Contracts and household relationships

Back up the persistent database and retain its matching image before upgrade.
Startup adds contract type definitions and storage for optional financial
facts, directed relationships, and incomplete information. Existing type
definitions, objects, and private drafts remain.
Use the upgraded image with this database; an older image requires its
matching backup. Stop the application before restoring that backup.

Backups contain financial facts and contract terms in private drafts, saved
objects, save receipts, and history. They also contain relationship proposals
and identity questions. Apply the same access restrictions and retention
rules to this information as to existing household content and private drafts.

### Production runtime base

The production container uses Alpine Linux 3.24. Rebuild the complete image
so native dependencies match the runtime. Before rollout, verify database
access and restart recovery on the deployment architecture. Keep the
previous image and its database backup available until these checks pass.

The running container has no operating-system or JavaScript package manager.
Install or update dependencies through an image build. Security findings at
High or Critical severity block a new delivery unless a reviewed, exact,
time-limited exception applies.

### Persistent objects and private drafts

Back up the persistent database and retain its matching image before upgrade.
Startup adds storage for objects, private drafts, history, and save receipts.
Existing households receive an initial Person object type. Keep the same
persistent disk across restarts. Backups now contain private drafts as well
as shared household content; restrict backup access accordingly.

An older image cannot open the upgraded database. Stop the application and
restore its matching backup before returning to that image. Changes after
the backup, including private drafts and receipts, will not be present.

### Verified login linking

Back up the persistent database and retain the matching image before
upgrade. Startup adds storage for login verification and preserves existing
users and memberships. An older image requires its matching database
backup; stop the application before restoring it.

Verify explicit linking with real Google and Microsoft logins after
deployment, including a personal Microsoft account. Check that both logins
reach the same user and household, and that denied consent leaves existing
access intact. Existing provider callback addresses remain valid. Do not
include tokens or identity proofs in logs or release evidence.

### First installation and persistent storage

Deploy one application instance with a persistent disk that the application
user can write to. Keep this disk and the authentication secret across
restarts and updates. A missing or replaced disk starts a separate empty
installation. Startup stops before traffic if database preparation fails;
correct the cause before you restore traffic.

### Identity and household access

Configure the first administrator with a verified provider account identifier
for each installation. Configure both identity providers and their public
callback addresses. Enable personal Microsoft accounts and verify real sign-in
with both providers before use. Email addresses do not grant access or link
accounts. After household creation, current membership controls access;
changing the configured first administrator does not transfer the household.

### Household invitations and database compatibility

Back up the persistent database before upgrade and retain the matching
application image. Startup adds storage for household invitations and keeps
existing households and memberships. No configuration changes are required.

An older application image cannot start with the upgraded database. To
return to that image, restore its matching database backup while the
application is stopped. Changes made after the backup will not be present.
