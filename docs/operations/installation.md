# Install and operate Skyttel

Skyttel runs as one Node.js application with SQLite on persistent local disk.
Run one application instance for each installation. A short interruption during
an update is expected. Each installation has its own database, authentication
secret, provider credentials, and configured first administrator.

## Supported runtime

- Node.js 24 LTS for running directly from a build.
- The production image includes the runtime and dependencies. It runs as
  the `node` user, UID/GID 1000.
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 for the local container workflow.
- A writable persistent filesystem for SQLite; use a local disk, not a shared
  network filesystem. The image stores its database in `/data/skyttel.sqlite`.

SQLite runs inside the application; no separate database service is required.
For production on Render, follow the [deployment runbook](render.md) to
configure the persistent disk, automatic digest deployment and recovery.
For provider registration and first administrator setup on the running
production service, use [production authentication](authentication.md).

## Configure the installation

For production, enter these settings through the host's private environment
controls. The [authentication guide](authentication.md) explains where each
identity setting comes from. It uses production sign-in and the production
database to identify the first administrator.

For a local developer installation, copy the blank example and edit only
the local file. Keep an existing `.env.local` if one is already present:

```sh
cp -n .env.example .env.local
chmod 600 .env.local
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Put the generated value in `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. Keep this value stable across
restarts. Use a different value for every installation. The example contains
no usable secret or personal identity. Do not commit the local file or put
secrets, provider identifiers, household information, or tokens in issues or
technical logs.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Variable | Required value |
| :-- | :-- |
| `SKYTTEL_ORIGIN` | Public HTTPS origin without a path, for example `https://skyttel.example.com`. Loopback HTTP is accepted for local development. |
| `SKYTTEL_DATABASE_PATH` | Writable SQLite file path. Compose sets `/data/skyttel.sqlite` inside its named volume. |
| `SKYTTEL_FIRST_ADMIN_PROVIDER` | `google` or `microsoft`. |
| `SKYTTEL_FIRST_ADMIN_SUBJECT` | The designated person's immutable provider account identifier. Never an email address or display name. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | A randomly generated secret of at least 32 characters. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Credentials for the installation's Google web application. |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Credentials for the installation's Microsoft web application. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional server-only project key for Skyttel's text assistant. Without it, manual map work remains available. |
| `PORT` | Optional; defaults to `3000`. Compose uses port `3000`. |
| `HOST` | Optional; defaults to `0.0.0.0`. |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Both providers must be configured. Invalid or incomplete configuration stops
startup before the application accepts traffic.

To enable the approved text assistant, follow the
[provider setup](../development/text-assistant.md#enable-real-provider-access).
Keep its optional key out of browser build variables and technical logs.

## Register identity providers

Follow the guide for the installation you are configuring:

- [Production authentication](authentication.md) covers provider accounts,
  registration, publishing choices, credentials, and checks on the deployed
  service. On Render, follow the [deployment sequence](render.md).
- [Local authentication](../development/local-authentication.md) covers
  developer registration, localhost callbacks, and local verification.

Both use a Google OAuth web application and a Microsoft Entra web
application. Register the exact callbacks for the installation's origin:

```text
https://skyttel.example.com/api/auth/callback/google
https://skyttel.example.com/api/auth/callback/microsoft
```

Use the provider's web application client secret on the server, never in
browser configuration.

The Microsoft registration must allow personal Microsoft accounts as well as
accounts in organizational directories. Skyttel uses the `common` authority.
Check the registration's supported account types; changing the authority
alone does not enable personal accounts. See the official
[Google setup](https://better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google),
[Microsoft setup](https://better-auth.com/docs/authentication/microsoft), and
[Microsoft audience guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/msal-client-application-configuration).

Before a production credential expires, follow
[provider secret renewal](authentication.md#renew-provider-secrets).
Create and verify a replacement in the same registration before removing the
old credential, and reload the application's environment after changing it.
The developer guide has a separate
[local Microsoft renewal procedure](../development/local-authentication.md#renew-the-microsoft-secret-before-it-expires).

## Designate the first administrator

Use Google's verified `sub` identifier or Microsoft's verified `oid` identifier
used by Better Auth 1.7. Obtain it through the provider's
authenticated identity flow and keep it private. Email addresses and names
do not authorize installation setup. See
[Google's identifier guidance](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
and [Better Auth's Microsoft account identifiers](https://better-auth.com/docs/authentication/microsoft#account-identifiers).

For a new production installation, first deploy with the intended provider
and `not-configured` as the subject. Then follow
[identify the first administrator on the running service](authentication.md#5-identify-the-first-administrator-on-the-running-service).
The procedure uses the intended person's production sign-in and a private,
read-only lookup on that service's database. It selects the specific
authenticated user rather than assuming that the first account is correct.
Replace the placeholder and deploy the changed environment before creating
the household. No separate local installation is needed for production setup.

For developer installations, follow the
[local first-household procedure](../development/local-authentication.md#continue-with-the-first-household).

Only the configured provider and identifier can create the installation's
first household. Once the household exists, current membership controls
access. Changing the first-administrator configuration does not transfer an
existing household or restore a removed member's access.

Provider accounts attach to a stable Skyttel user. Matching email addresses
do not link accounts automatically. Users can explicitly link Google and
Microsoft from **Inloggningssätt** by verifying both identities; either
linked provider then reaches the same user and household. See the
[login-linking steps](../users/access.md#link-google-and-microsoft).

## Build, start, and restart

For the local Compose workflow, after filling every required value:

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
curl --fail http://localhost:3000/healthz
```

Open [local Skyttel](http://localhost:3000), log in as the designated
administrator, and create the household. The health response is
`{"status":"ok"}` only after configuration, database initialization, and all
versioned migrations succeed.

```sh
docker compose restart skyttel
curl --fail http://localhost:3000/healthz
```

Wait for readiness, then return in the same browser and check the household.
The named volume retains household records, identities, and sessions across
container restarts and replacements. `docker compose down` keeps that volume;
adding `--volumes` deletes it and its household data.

Before updating, read the [operator upgrade notes](operator-upgrade-notes.md),
download a [complete household export](../users/household-export.md), and
retain the matching application image. Build the
new image, keep the same volume and secret, and run `docker compose up -d`
again. Do not run old and new application versions against the same SQLite
volume at the same time. To return to an older image after a schema change,
establish compatibility first. An export restores household content through
a compatible application; it does not roll back the database schema or
restore authentication state. See [recovery and moving](recovery.md).

## Deploy on a container host

The same image can run on a normal container host, including Render. Supply
configuration through the host's secret settings and attach persistent disk
at `/data`. Make the mounted directory writable by UID/GID 1000 before
starting the application. A host-mounted directory can replace the ownership
provided by the image. Keep the database, WAL, and shared-memory files on the
same persistent disk.

Set the public HTTPS origin and register its provider callback URIs. Route
HTTPS through the host's ingress to the application's `PORT`, and use
`/healthz` as the readiness check. The example Compose service binds only to
loopback for local use; configure ingress separately for remote access. Run
exactly one instance and allow a deployment interruption.

## Startup failures and storage

A failed migration or inaccessible database exits with failure and no ready
listener. A fixed error event such as `database_initialization_failed` appears
in the technical log with a safe reason such as `database_unavailable` or
`migration_failed`. Configuration failures identify the affected variable
name. Private values, paths, SQL, and exception details do not appear. Keep the
service out of traffic and check disk availability, write permission, free
space, and the deployed migration files. Correct the cause and restart. Do not
delete the database or edit migration history to force a healthy state.

Skyttel provides complete versioned household export and import, without
extra automatic backup. Keep your own private exports outside the running
disk. [Restore or move the household](recovery.md) into a new installation
with fresh access and explicit historical-owner assignments. Persistent disk
protects ordinary restarts; it does not protect against loss of the disk.
Everything since the latest usable export can be lost in a major failure,
and recovery can require several days.

## Verify before opening access

Check the deployed HTTPS origin, provider callbacks, fresh sign-in with both
providers, and household access after a restart. Include a personal Microsoft
account and verify that linked logins reach the same household. Follow the
[production sign-in checks](authentication.md#6-verify-production-sign-in)
for the full procedure. A successful health check or automated test run does
not verify the installation's real provider registrations.
