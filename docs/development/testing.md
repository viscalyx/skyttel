# Develop and test Skyttel

Use Node.js 24 LTS, npm 12, and the committed npm lockfile.
`packageManager` pins the npm release used by development, CI, and builds.
Native `better-sqlite3` installation requires a supported prebuilt binary or
Python, a C/C++ compiler, and Make. The Docker build supplies these tools in
its build stage.

The [devcontainer guide](devcontainer.md) provides the complete Linux
development environment, client/server startup, persistent development data,
and tool configuration. Run checks explicitly after starting the container.

## Install and build

```sh
node scripts/install-repository-npm.mjs
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run lint:docs
npm run build
```

For a local production build, configure `.env.local` according to the
[installation guide](../operations/installation.md), then start the application
with that environment loaded:

```sh
node --env-file=.env.local dist/server/index.js
```

The database directory must be writable. The server serves the Vite client
build and the API from the same origin.

## Disposable local browser session

Use this setup when a browser check must replace household content. It runs
inside the devcontainer with the host browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
Complete the normal [development login setup](devcontainer.md#run-the-application)
first; the [authentication walkthrough](local-authentication.md) explains
provider registration. The configured first administrator signs in with
that existing account. Household names and information must be invented.
No public address, tunnel, new provider registration, or assistant is needed.

Stop the normal `npm run dev:all` with Ctrl+C and keep ports 3300 and 5173
free. From the repository root, run this block in a terminal that you keep
open for the whole check. It creates a new empty database without running
`db:setup` or changing the ordinary development database. Provider settings
come from the same private environment file as normal development:
`SKYTTEL_DEV_ENV_FILE`, or `.devcontainer/.env` when it is not set.

```sh
umask 077
SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/skyttel-browser-case.XXXXXX)
printf 'SKYTTEL_DATABASE_PATH=%s/skyttel.sqlite\n' \
  "$SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR" > "$SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR/case.env"
env -u SKYTTEL_DATABASE_PATH \
  node --env-file="$SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR/case.env" scripts/develop.mjs
```

Open a fresh private browser window on the host, sign in and create the
requested household. If two profiles are required, use two separate browser
profiles, both signed in as the same configured administrator. Session
cookies are profile-local. Keep any downloaded synthetic archives in a
separate private folder on the host.

For a restart within the check, press Ctrl+C, wait for both development
processes to stop, and run only this command in the same terminal. It uses
the same database, sessions, and household:

```sh
env -u SKYTTEL_DATABASE_PATH \
  node --env-file="$SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR/case.env" scripts/develop.mjs
```

Reload the browser after startup. Do not rerun the directory-creation block
or `db:setup` during a persistence check. When finished, stop the server,
close the test browser windows, remove downloaded test archives, and delete
only this temporary directory in the same terminal:

```sh
rm -r -- "${SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR:?}"
unset SKYTTEL_BROWSER_CASE_DIR
```

Start the ordinary environment again with `npm run dev:all`. For another
isolated check, create a fresh directory with the first block.

## Application unit tests and lint

For reproducible text-provider delay and failure checks without a real key,
use the [controlled local launcher](manual-text-assistant.md). It keeps
the actual browser, MCP and SQLite paths and substitutes only outside
providers. Real provider setup is documented in the
[text assistant guide](text-assistant.md).

Vitest exercises public application functions, rendered React screens, and
HTTP handlers. SQLite-backed behavior uses temporary real databases;
external provider responses and browser network requests use synthetic
fixtures. The graphics project renders the public spatial component in real
headless Chromium with Three.js and WebGL 2. It uses the existing Playwright
browser installation and contributes browser V8 coverage to the same report
as the Node and jsdom projects. Install Chromium before the first Vitest run.
Coverage includes every TypeScript and TSX file under `src`,
including entry points. Tests do not reach into private application helpers.
Coverage gates require 85% of statements, lines, and functions, and 90% of
branches.

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/server/config.test.ts
npm run test:unit -- --project graphics
npm run test:unit:coverage
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

Biome checks application and test code, scripts, CSS, and root configuration.
The project keeps single quotes and semicolons. Markdown lint and cSpell
remain separate checks. CI enforces these checks and the application suites.

## Isolated application checks

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
```

`npm test` builds the application and runs Vitest followed by Playwright.
The Playwright suite drives the application through the browser and public HTTP
endpoints, uses real SQLite databases in temporary directories, and supplies
only synthetic users and households. Each installation has independent
storage and a configured first administrator. Provider sign-in uses a test
substitute; verify real registrations separately as described below.

These checks cover installation setup, server-side access decisions,
independent installations, same-email identities, current membership,
revoked access, and restart persistence. Browser checks include recoverable
startup errors, denied Google and Microsoft consent with successful retry,
keyboard operation, and a narrow mobile viewport. Tests must never use live
provider credentials, real households, or production storage. Keep generated
traces and reports local; their inputs must remain synthetic.

Run a focused test file while changing a feature, and run typechecking again
after changing the shared contract. Run the full suite after completing the
change. Rebuild before a focused browser test so it uses the latest client:

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/bootstrap.spec.ts
```

For controlled large-map timing measurements, run `npm run measure:map`
separately from other suites. The [measurement plan](large-map-performance.md)
defines the synthetic dataset, network conditions, readiness boundaries and
report options. Functional large-map checks remain in the integration suite.

To generate an HTML report and open it on port 9324, use:

```sh
npm run test:integration -- --reporter=html
npm run test:report
```

Do not replace SQLite with an in-memory repository mock. Arrange membership
scenarios with fixtures and assert through the public HTTP interface.

The Playwright suite covers keyboard use and widths of 320 pixels through
browser viewport emulation. This does not verify a physical iPhone or iPad.
Run `npm run check` for typechecking, Biome, documentation checks, workflow
gate tests, the build, Vitest coverage, and Playwright. Production image
changes also require the separate `npm run test:container` check.

## Environment and real-provider checks

With Docker available, `npm run test:devcontainer` checks both development
profiles using isolated storage. It verifies configuration preservation,
the first storage transition, restart and container recreation. CI runs
this separately from the application suite. Configuration process tests
also run in `npm run test:gates`. See the
[persistence guide](devcontainer-persistence.md#automatiskt-prov-av-omstart-och-ombyggnad)
for requirements and the boundary around personal account sign-in.

The following commands are separate opt-in checks with private configuration:

- `npm run test:real-model`: actual model interpretation through MCP,
  including negative, hypothetical and positive save instructions.
  Follow the [model evaluation guide](real-model-tests.md).
- `npm run test:real-voice`: recorded Swedish speech through actual WebRTC,
  Live and Terra, with observable saved data and a durable receipt.
  Follow the [speech evaluation guide](real-voice-tests.md).
- `npm run test:installation`: read-only verification of HTTPS, deployed
  version and recent security monitoring against the actual Render images.
  Follow the [monitoring guide](../operations/security-monitoring.md#automated-live-verification).

Missing configuration fails these commands. It is not a passed or skipped
verification. Ordinary CI does not call paid providers or use live accounts.
Record the tested commit and actual outcomes separately from discovery and
tests using provider substitutes. An automatic result cannot establish
what a person heard or whether they noticed a notification.

## Pull request gates

The Operator Upgrade Gate checks every pull request to `main` except those
authored by `dependabot[bot]`. For other pull requests, select exactly one
operator-impact declaration in the pull request template.
`Operator notes updated` requires a meaningful addition or correction under
`## Unreleased` in the committed operator notes.
Formatting, source markers, removal-only changes, and release history do not
count as updated guidance. `No operator notes needed` still requires a valid
notes document. The gate verifies the declaration and notes structure;
reviewers assess whether the guidance covers the actual operational impact.

The SSDLC Gate requires the template's security-review checkbox for changes
to application code, persistence, dependencies, deployment, authentication,
security documentation, or development and CI security controls. Ordinary
documentation-only changes can pass without the checkbox. Dependabot pull
requests skip both gates. The workflows check the pull request author, so
the exemption also applies when a maintainer edits a Dependabot pull request.
A checked box records the author's assessment and does not replace security
review or security testing.

Both gates rerun when a pull request opens, receives commits, reopens, changes
its description, or becomes ready for review. They evaluate committed notes
and the pull request description using the gate scripts on the base branch.
Changes to those scripts in a pull request do not affect its own gate run.
API failures or incomplete evidence fail the check.

After a successful gate run, maintainers can select the
`operator-upgrade-gate` and `ssdlc-gate` checks in the `main` branch rules to
require them before merging. The workflow files alone do not change branch
protection.
See GitHub's [pull request target documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)
for the execution context.

Run the dependency-free gate tests with Node.js 24:

```sh
npm run test:gates
```

Application CI runs these tests too. To check a real pull request, use the
read-only GitHub API mode with a suitable token in the environment; keep the
token out of command arguments and logs:

```sh
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=viscalyx/skyttel
node scripts/release/operator-upgrade-gate.mjs --github-pr 66
node scripts/security/ssdlc-gate.mjs --github-pr 66
```

Both commands read `GITHUB_TOKEN`. An unchecked SSDLC declaration on a
security-sensitive change must fail until the assessment is complete.

## Dependency updates

`.github/dependabot.yml` enables weekly version-update checks for the root
npm project, GitHub Actions, and production Docker base. Each dependency gets
a separate pull request.
The configuration takes effect on `main`. GitHub supplies the Dependabot
update workflow, so no custom workflow file is needed. See GitHub's
[Dependabot configuration guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/secure-your-dependencies/configure-version-updates).

Use `npm run purge:install` explicitly during dependency maintenance. It
empties `node_modules`, clears the npm cache, and regenerates the lockfile
with native optional packages available. The mounted `node_modules`
directory itself stays in place. Select dependency versions before running
the command; it does not change version declarations. Inspect both manifest
and lockfile changes, then run `npm run check`.

npm 12 requires reviewed dependency installation scripts. The committed
`allowScripts` entries approve exact versions, and `.npmrc` rejects
unreviewed scripts. Review changed lifecycle scripts before updating an
approval. Use `npm ci` for ordinary setup and CI; purge is never automatic.

Review each update and let application CI validate it. Dependabot pull
requests skip the Operator Upgrade and SSDLC gates, so their descriptions
do not need the template declarations. Reviewers must still assess operational
impact and commit meaningful operator notes when needed. Updates do not merge
automatically.

All updates run the mandatory application and security checks. See the
[security checks guide](security-checks.md) for failure policy, container
exceptions, repository settings, and how to attach new feature tests.

After updating Playwright, install its matching Chromium browser with
`npx playwright install chromium`. Keep `.node-version`, the `package.json`
engine range, and both production Dockerfile base references compatible.
For development tool updates and rebuild checks, follow the
[devcontainer guide](devcontainer.md#tools-and-updates). Run the
production-container checks when production inputs change.

## Devcontainer development

Follow the [devcontainer guide](devcontainer.md) to prepare the environment
and start the application. When changing the development configuration,
container creation runs `npm run db:migrate` and preserves existing data.
A new database has an empty schema until you create a household or explicitly
seed demo data. After a rebuild, start the application, check the tools, and
confirm that saved content, private drafts, and personal settings remain.
Use `npm run test:devcontainer` for the isolated rebuild and persistence
check. Run application checks explicitly; container startup does not run them.

Use `npm run db:setup` to replace the development database contents with
`TestHousehold` and its configured administrator. Follow the
[demo data setup](devcontainer.md#reset-demo-data) before running it; the
command removes all existing application data and sessions. Add reusable
demo fixtures in `scripts/seeds/demo.ts`. Automated tests continue to use
their own temporary databases and synthetic provider identities.

Run the seed and family scenarios with:

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:integration -- \
  tests/integration/database-setup.spec.ts tests/integration/family.spec.ts
```

The HTTP and browser map tests exercise draft privacy, version conflicts,
atomic rollback, receipts, and reopening. The family scenario also covers
relationship duplication, concurrent additions, incomplete information,
identity questions, deletion review, and the actual demo seed. Only external
identity providers are substituted; SQLite and the application remain real.
Failure tests inject a SQLite write error or interrupt an HTTP response.

`tests/integration/draft-conflicts.spec.ts` orders requests from separate
users and clients against the running app and real SQLite. It covers
whole-draft rollback, stale resolution choices and approvals, private
draft access, membership revocation, independent saves, overlapping
objects and relationships, duplicate links, and deleted endpoints.
Browser checks require an explicit conflict choice followed by a new save.
They also verify that a resolved draft and readable relationship proposals
survive normal server restart. The fixtures use only fictional identities
and content; no timing delays decide which writer wins.

## Production-container checks

With a running Docker daemon:

```sh
npm run test:container
```

This builds the production Dockerfile, runs it with disposable storage and
synthetic configuration, checks readiness and its unprivileged runtime user,
checks that test authentication is unavailable, and exercises restart and
failed-migration behavior. The production image contains built application
files, migrations, and production dependencies. It has no test entry point.

The check also verifies authenticated household access before and after a
production-container restart using synthetic identities and data.
It uploads synthetic pixels through the production image endpoint, checks
the returned WebP dimensions with the native image processor, and checks
private and saved image persistence across container replacement.
It also verifies private draft recovery, saved objects, history, and repeated
saving with the same receipt across container restarts.
Public OAuth checks register synthetic native clients, obtain separate
read and map-work consent, and verify whole-draft MCP saving, receipt
recovery after restart, read-only isolation and connection revocation.
Only the browser's initial synthetic identity is arranged by the fixture;
assistant tokens and consent use the production HTTP flow.

Temporary test containers and volumes are removed after the check. These
checks do not deploy to Render and do not certify a provider registration,
ingress configuration, disk service, or a different CPU architecture.

## Verify real identity providers separately

`tests/integration/linking.spec.ts` exercises the running app's public
linking flow with persistent SQLite and deterministic providers. It covers
both identity proofs, matching and different email addresses, occupied and
wrong identities, denied consent, provider failures, cancellation, session
binding, and the verified browser result. These checks do not verify live
provider policy or personal Microsoft account support. Use synthetic data
only; never put tokens or identity proofs in technical logs or test reports.

If you are new to provider registration, start with the
[local authentication walkthrough](local-authentication.md).

For a manual Codex CLI connection inside the devcontainer, use the
[local assistant setup](assistants.md#manual-local-codex-cli-setup).
It reuses development Google credentials with the port-3301 callback and a
disposable database. Normal development login uses the port-5173 callback
on the same Google client. This live-client check is excluded from CI and
pull request workflows; do not add provider secrets or a Codex login to run
it there. Automated tests retain their synthetic identity providers.

Use a private verification installation with its own persistent disk, secret,
and provider registrations. Register the correct callback URLs and authorize
Google test accounts if its consent screen requires them. Do not post tokens,
subjects, personal email addresses, screenshots with identity details, or
household data in public evidence.

1. Configure a controlled Google identity as first administrator. Complete the
   actual Google redirect and consent flow, create a synthetic household,
   sign out, and sign in again.
2. Restart the production container and confirm that the same household and
   provider identity are retained.
3. Repeat in a separate installation with a personal Microsoft account as
   first administrator. An organizational Microsoft account alone does not
   verify personal-account support.
4. Confirm that another authenticated identity cannot create or access the
   household, including direct API requests. If using matching email
   addresses across providers, confirm they do not merge automatically.
5. Verify logout, denied consent, and a provider error. Confirm that the page
   gives a usable retry path and technical logs contain no secret or identity
   detail.
6. Open **Inloggningssätt**, prove the existing login, then link a controlled
   identity from the other provider. Include a personal Microsoft account.
   Check the verified result, sign out, and sign in with each provider.
   Confirm the same Skyttel user ID and household access. Repeat with denied
   consent and an identity already owned by another Skyttel user; earlier
   access must remain intact.

Record the date, image digest, provider, Microsoft account category, scenarios,
and pass/fail result in private release evidence. State explicitly which
checks are deterministic and which use a real provider. Passing the automated
suite alone is not a claim of live Google or Microsoft sign-in success.

Verify the deployed HTTPS origin and callback URLs before release. Local
HTTP checks do not verify hosted ingress or provider policies for that
deployment. Test physical mobile devices separately when they are part of
the release's target platforms; browser viewport emulation is insufficient.
